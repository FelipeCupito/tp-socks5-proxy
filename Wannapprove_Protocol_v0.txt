1. Introduction

The protocol defined here allows an administrator user for a server implementing SOCKS5 [1]. The main task that this administrator can perform is changing settings of the server and its state, mainly the users' information. 

2. Procedure

When a TCP-based client wishes to take control of a SOCKS5 server, it must open a TCP connection to the WANNAPPROVE (8080) port on the server system. Then, if this request succeeds, the client entering must authenticate with the right admin password to be allowed to connect. For this it must sent the request details.

The WANNAPPROVE request is structured thus:

	+---------+---------+----------+
	| VERSION | PASSLEN | PASSWD   |
	+---------+---------+----------+
	| X'00'   | 1       | 1 to 255 |
	+---------+---------+----------+
	
	Where:
		o VERSION protocol version: X'00'
		o PASSLEN number of bytes of the incoming password
		o PASSWD the actual password

Then the WANNAPPROVE server will evaluate the format of the request and if the password is correct it will send the following response:

	+--------+
	| STATUS |
	+--------+
	| 1      |
	+--------+
	
	Where STATUS can be:
		o OK X'00', the client has connected
		o ERROR_IN_VERSION X'01', incorrect version number
		o ERROR_IN_PASSLEN: X'02', passlen was zero or negative
		o ERROR: X'03', unkown error
		o AUTH_FAIL: X'04', the password didn’t match
			
3. Request

	After being correctly authenticated, the client will send a request indicating which action it wants to perform, where te possible actions with their respective codes are the following:

	Actions:
		- GET X'00'
		- PUT X'01'
		- EDIT X'02'
		- CONFIGBUFFSIZE X'03'
		- CONFIGSTATUS X'04'
		- DELETE X'05'

	As the necessary information that each action requires will vary from one action to another, the requests for each action will also differ. The structure for each action is as follows:

	3.1. GET ACTION

	This action allows the administrator to query data of a SOCKS5 server.

		<<	Request for GET ACTION

			+--------+--------+
			| ACTION | OPTION |
			+--------+--------+
			| X'00'  | 1      |
			+--------+--------+

			Where OPTION can be: 
				o USERS X'00'
				o PASSWORDS X'01'
				o BUFFERSIZE X'02'
				o AUTH STATUS X'03'
				o SPOOFING STATUS X'04'
				o SENT BYTES X'05'
				o RECEIVED BYTES X'06'
				o HISTORIC CONNECTIONS X'07'
				o CURRENT CONNECTIONS X'08'

		>>	Reply for GET ACTION

			+--------+--------+----------+
			| STATUS | RESLEN | RES      |

			+--------+--------+----------+
			
			Where STATUS can be:
				o OK X'00'
				o ERROR_INVALID_ACTION X'01'
				o ERROR_INVALID_OPTION X'02'
				o ERROR X'03', unknown error

	3.2. PUT ACTION

	This action allows the administrator to add data to a SOCKS5 server, in this version it can only add users.
